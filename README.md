My first project for learning about the espanso text expander program. Link to project https://github.com/federico-terzi/espanso

modules included:
duke-nukem-quotes -> expands a phrase into a random Duke Nukem quote stored in a text file.
now-playing -> expands a phrase into this message -> I am currently listening to "Epitaph" by King Crimson from the album "Radical Action To Unseat the Hold of Monkey Mind (Live)"
