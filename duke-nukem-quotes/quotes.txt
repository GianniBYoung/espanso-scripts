Bitchin'!
Blow it out your ass! 
Boooorn tooo beee wiiiiiiild... 
Come get some! 
Damn....
Damn, I'm good! 
Damn... I'm looking good! 
Damn, those alien bastards are gonna pay for shooting up my ride.
Damn, that's the second time those alien bastards shot up my ride!
Damn, you're ugly. 
Do, or do not. There is no try. 
Eat shit and die.
Get that crap outta here! 
Die, you son of a bitch! 
Get back to work, you slacker! 
Go ahead, make my day. 
Gonna rip 'em a new one.
Guess again, freakshow. I'm coming back to town, and the last thing that's gonna go through your mind before you die... is my size-13 boot! 
Hail to the king, baby! 
Heh, heh, heh... What a mess! 
Hmm, don't have time to play with myself. 
Hmm, that's one doomed space marine. 
Holy cow!
Holy shit!
I'll rip your head off and shit down your neck. 
I'm gonna get medieval on your asses! 
I'm gonna kick your ass, bitch!
I'm gonna put this smack dab on your ass!
I ain't afraid of no quake! 
I like a good cigar...and a bad woman...
I should have known those alien maggots booby-trapped this sub.
It's time to kick ass and chew bubble gum... and I'm all outta gum. 
It's down to you and me, you one-eyed freak! 
It's time to abort your whole freaking species! 
Let God sort 'em out! 
Looks like cleanup on aisle four.
Lucky son of a bitch.
Mess with the best, you will die like the rest 
My name is Duke Nukem, and I'm coming to get the rest of you alien bastards! 
No way I'm eating this shit!
Nobody steals our chicks... and lives!
Now this is a force to be reckoned with! 
Oh...your ass is grass and I've got the weed-whacker.
Ooh, I needed that! 
Ooh, that's gotta hurt. 
Shake it, baby! 
Shit happens. 
Sometimes I even amaze myself. 
Staying alive, staying alive, la. 
Suck it down!
They don't make 'em better than me!
This really pisses me off!
This is KTIT, K-Tit! Playing the breast- uhh, the best tunes in town.
That's gonna leave a mark!
We meet again, Doctor Jones! 
What? There's only one of you?
What are you waitin' for? Christmas? 
What are you? Some bottom-feeding, scum-sucking algae eater?
Who wants some? 
Yeah, piece of cake!
Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker! 
You guys suck!
You're an inspiration for birth control.
Your face, your ass. What's the difference?
You wanna dance? 
I was born to rock the world! 
Always bet on Duke! 
I'm lookin' for some alien toilet to park my bricks... Who's first? 
Good, bad, I'm the guy with the gun! 
Damn it, why do they always take the hot ones?
Right in the jewels.
Rest in pieces.
What? Did you think I was gone forever? 
Hell, I'd still hit it.
Coochi-Coochi.
"Hail to the King, baby!" Reference to Army Of Darkness - Ash - played by Bruce Campbell
Holsom Twin: What about the game, Duke? Was it any good?
Duke: Yeah, but after 12 fucking years it should be!
I've got balls of steel.
Hail to the King, baby!
Suck it down!
I'm gonna rip your eye out and piss on your brain, you alien dirtbag!
My job is to kick ass, not make small talk.
Looks like those alien bastards drank all my beer.
Not my babes! Not in my town! You alien motherfuckers are gonna pay for this!
Take your pills...er...vitamins every day and you might grow up to be as awesome as me.
Take your tentacles back to Japan, you freak! 
My balls, your face.
All right, time for my reward! 
Anybody mind if I... take off my pants?
Looks like those alien bastards drank all my beer.
Hmm... convenient.
Holy shit!
I'm from Las Vegas, and I say: kill 'em all. 
I guess pigs DO fly! 
It's down to you and me!
No! Come on! No!
I'm the Duke, I'm A-number 1. 
Oh yeah! I'm bringing sexy back. 
A turd in the hand is worth two in the bush. 
Power armor is for pussies! 
Size only matters when you're full grown, baby!
This is taking forever. Time to stop pissing around and get this big guy back into action. Woah, that water's cold. 
Tonight, You dine in hell! 
A crowbar would come in handy right about now. 
Bonjour, le hot stuff.
Squeal piggy! Squeal 
Dammit Leroy! 
That's one Dead Space marine.
America, fuck yeah.
Good, Bad, I'm the guy with the gun! 
Crumble like a shit cookie! 
I don't dig on swine. 
I'm going to kill you old style. 
I hate valve puzzles! 
You've got a lot of guts. Let's see what they look like. 
I'd buy that for a dollar. 
Did I promise to kill you last? I lied. 
"Tonight...you".
Duke wins.... Fatality! 
If it bleeds, I can kill it 
What am I, a Chimpanzee? 
What's new, pussycat? 
What kind of sick motherfucker picks up wet feces?
Yeah, this should help.
Yeehaw, motherfucker! 
Vroom vroom, motherfucker! 
You wanna touch it, don't you? 
I got balls of steel!
Who wants white meat? Who wants it? 
Dear diary... Jackpot! 
Seriously, a nutless monkey can do your job 
This is gonna fuck up my hair!
I've got balls of fail!
Time to redecorate, in brain matter grey.
Quit bleeding, pussy!
Another day, another disembowelment.
I oughta break a broomhandle off in your ass.
Just call me "Frankenstein." 
Aww, and it got such good gas mileage! 
Well, enough talk then. Come get some! Oh, Silverback, one more thing. I'm gonna enjoy pissin' on your dead body!
Welcome to "Cool's-Ville", Population: Me. 
I'm your worst nightmare, you uninvited alien scum-sucker! And right now you're all that stands between me and a planet full of babes - so get ready to bend over and kiss your ass goodbye!
I'm climbing a ladder........to heaven. 
Suck my d**k you little alien f**ks, bleeped out.
Ah, New York! It's my kind of town. If I can kill 'em here...I can kill 'em anywhere! / Reference to Frank Sinatra's song "New York" 
Babe: "Duke, you're my hero!" Duke: "You must be 18 or older to ride."
Babes, bullets, bombs. Damn - I love this job!
Batteries not included! 
Come on out, Morphix. There's just two ways this can end, and in both of them, you die!
Confucius say... DIE!
Crouching mutant, hidden pipebomb! 
Dance for me, baby!
Death before Disco! 
Die bitch! 
Don't get your panties all in a bunch.
Guns don't kill mutants, I kill mutants.
Half man, half animal, all dead. 
Hey, careful with those things! 
Hmm, so there is life after death... 
Hmmm... That's gonna leave a mark. 
Hmmm...the other white meat.
I always said, if there was a way to go, it'd have something to do with women, whips, and oil...
I am king of the world, baby! 
I'm an equal opportunity asskicker!
I'm not gonna fight you, I'm gonna KICK YOUR ASS!
I can do this all day... 
I could use some new boots. 
I don't do windows.
I go where I please, and I please where I go. 
I hate pigs! 
I kill bugs...DEAD! 
I like big guns, and I cannot lie. 
I love the smell of burnt crap in the morning. 
I see dead people. 
It's a good day to die! 
It's clobbering time! 
It's my way or... Hell, it's my way! 
It's scares tripping time!
Life is like a box of ammo. 
Looks like I'm on Candy Camera 
Looks like your hardware's gone a little soft, Morphix! 
Makin'...bacon! 
Morphix and his glop rig are going down faster than enron. 
Mother F-
My gun's bigger than yours. 
No token, no ride! 
No disassembling required. 
Now I'm really pissed off! 
Oops, I did it again! 
Pucker up, buttercup! 
Say "hello" to my little friend! 
Sewer scum! 
Should've stayed in the swamp! 
So many babes, so little time.
So much for the rat pack! 
So, who wants to dance?! 
Someone's gonna pay for making me find these friggin' key cards...
Sorry, honey, I've got some asskickin' to do first! 
Squeal like a pig! 
Stop eyeballin' me! 
Surprise, surprise, I need a keycard.
Take that, you dirty rat! 
This is why I have games named after me!
Time for mutation-mutilation! 
Time for a reboot! 
Time to deliver max pain on the A-Train...now where'd I put that subway token? 
Time to deworm the Big Apple...
This'll be a barrel of laughs.
This room is bugged.
What a pussy! 
What am I? A frog? 
Who wants to glow in the dark? 
You're goin' down faster than the XFL! 
You're starting to bug me. 
You are the missing link. Goodbye. 
Your kung-fu's through! 
You talkin' to me? 
Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of Duke Nukem. My continuing mission : to explore strange new babes, to seek out new aliens and kick their asses.
Dying ain't much of a living boy.
Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your chicks.

Looks like the crap has hit the fan. 
Female Commander: New York is in trouble Duke, the alien scum have taken over of the area around Liberty Island. Without immediate intervention they'll get the whole damn city. Your helicopter is waiting, go kick some ass...
Marine: I'm cocked, locked, and ready to rock! 
Mess with the best, die like the rest.
